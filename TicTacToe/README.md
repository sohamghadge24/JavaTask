# TicTacToe Game

## Description

This project is a simple implementation of the classic TicTacToe game in Java, using Swing for the graphical user interface. The game supports two players taking turns to make moves on a 3x3 grid, and it checks for wins, draws, and player switching.

## Features

- Graphical user interface with a 3x3 grid of buttons.
- Players take turns making moves (X or O).
- Checks for wins horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
- Detects draws when the board is full.
- Simple user interface with player turn information.
